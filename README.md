- Flask REST API which predicts the probability of Coronary Heart Disease in a patient taking 9 different parameters based on the patient's history as input.
- The API uses a Logistic Regression Model from sci-kit-learn trained on the [Framingham Heart Study Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/amanajmera1/framingham-heart-study-dataset) from Kaggle.
- The model achieved a test accuracy of around 88%.

## Predict Endpoint

- Takes 9 parameters as input
- Returns a binary prediction (0 or 1) and probability as well.
